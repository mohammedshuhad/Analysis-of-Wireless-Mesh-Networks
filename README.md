# Analysis-of-Wireless-Mesh-Networks
Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is a wireless, ad hoc, communication network made up of two or more wireless radio nodes arranged in mesh topology. The radio nodes are less dynamic and more static, causing the nodes to spend more time in delivering the data rather than updating the routes. The nodes seek to create the most optimum path to deliver the data from the first node that received the information to the destination node. One of the contributing factors that impact the performance of a WMN is the underlying routing protocol used. In this project, we aim to simulate a WMN as well as apply different routing protocols on it. The performance of the different protocols will be analyzed based on routing parameters using the ns-3 simulation software.
